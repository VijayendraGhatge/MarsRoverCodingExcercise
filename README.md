# MarsRoverCodingExcercise
This is a coding excercise. This is done in Dotnet in a console application.

Guidlines followed for the excericise: 
1. I have tried to use minimum number of external frameworks (hence no DI/IoC or Mock frameworks used). But to one exception i.e. NUnit. I have used NUnit as the only other framework then .Net Core. To keep the minimum dependency.
2. I have also made the code modular and ready for any framework introduction e.g. DI to be used if needed.
3. Due to time constraint of 2 hrs. I have tried to restrict myself to adding only those unit tests that tests the main logic of the
application that drives the expected output.
4. I have tried to keep the application as modular as possible. And keeping SOLID principals in mind. Also tried to follow principals like DRY, KIS.
5. I have also tried to keep the code qualitiy to the highiest possible.

System Requirements:
1. Visual Studio 2017 (Development done in 2019 so would recommend that)
2. .Net Core 3.1
3. NUnit
